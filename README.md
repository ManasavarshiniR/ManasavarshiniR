Network Traffic Analyzer Code Breakdown


Library Integration

The code utilizes Python's Scapy library for packet capture and Matplotlib for visualization, offering real-time insights into network traffic.


Packet Processing and Analysis

1. Import necessary libraries: Scapy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and Tkinter.
2. Define variables for packet counts, time windows, and protocol distributions.
3. process_packet function (Scapy callback):
- Extracts source/destination IP addresses, protocol numbers.
- Updates packet counts.


Visualization and Graphics

1. Matplotlib plot updates every second.
2. Two subplots:
- Left: Packet counts over time.
- Right: Captured IP addresses.
1. update_plot function updates plot data.


User Interface Implementation

1. Tkinter GUI for better scrolling support.
2. Displays Matplotlib plot.


Concurrency and Performance

1. Packet capture thread (Scapy).
2. Packet count update thread.
3. Plot update thread.


Main Execution

1. run_gui initializes GUI, starts packet capture, and updates packet counts/plots.


Key Functionality

1. Real-time network traffic visualization.
2. Packet count and protocol distribution tracking.
3. Captured IP address display.
4. Multithreading for smooth performance.


Future Development

1. Filter packets by protocol/IP address.
2. Implement alert systems for suspicious traffic.
3. Integrate with databases for long-term analysis.
4. Expand visualization option

Overview of Chart.js Implementation

This HTML code leverages Chart.js to create a dynamic line chart visualizing network traffic data, showcasing HTTP, FTP, and DNS traffic in megabytes (MB).


Core Components

1. Time Stamp Initialization: 20 initial time labels, each representing 5-second intervals.
2. Traffic Data Structure: An object containing time stamps and three datasets (HTTP, FTP, DNS) with initial values set to 0.
3. Chart Configuration Options: Defines chart type, data, responsiveness, title, legend, tooltips, and scales.
4. Real-Time Data Simulation: The updateTrafficData function generates random values, shifts old data, and appends new points.


Real-Time Visualization Workflow

1. Initialization Phase: Chart initialization with 20 time labels and zero dataset values.
2. Data Update Cycle: Every 5 seconds, new random data points are generated and old data is shifted.
3. Data Point Management: Maintains a fixed number of data points (20) by removing old and adding new ones.
4. Chart Refresh: Updates the chart to reflect changes, creating a real-time visualization effect.


Configuration and Customization

- Adjust maxDataPoints to change displayed data points.
- Modify updateTrafficData to incorporate actual network traffic data.
- Customize chart appearance, colors, and scales.


Benefits and Advantages

- Real-time visualization for monitoring network traffic patterns.
- Interactive chart for detailed data point information.
- Customizable for various network traffic data sources.


Future Development and Enhancements

- Integrate with actual network traffic data sources.
- Implement multiple chart types (e.g., bar, pie) for comparative analysis.
- Add alerts for unusual traffic patterns or thresholds.
- Explore machine learning-based traffic prediction models.
